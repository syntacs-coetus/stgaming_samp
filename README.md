Note: If you are in affilation doesn't mean that you are safe from the government, with enough budget the police can pay up for information on a certain player. This budget will become a reputation for the affiliation.

## Features

- Forum Integrated Login
- Affiliation Tutorial System
  - Tutorial that would defer on what affiliation the player is connected.
- Character Affiliation System:
  - Black Mambas
  - Silver Knights
  - Government(For Admins, Moderators and Selected Players)
- Affialiation Registration System
  - Players can either choose to join an affiliation or not
  - Players who joins affiliations will have affiliations perk as they level up
  - Players can also leave their affiliation
- Group System and Gang System
  - Aside from affiliations players can create their own small gangs which will be under the affiliation.
  - Only players not inside an affiliation can create or join a gang
  - There is also a group system which could only consist of 8 people. The prerequisite number of people on a group before players can create a small gang.
  - Groups can be created by anyone but only the highest ranking member can further the group into a gang.
  - Once a gang is created the group is disolved but it doesn't stop a player from joining other groups and creating their own groups, they won't just be allowed to create a gang. Nor will they be able to join another gang and even take part on its creation.
- Hit System
  - The affiliation gets one random online player from the opposite affiliation into a hit list.
  - The group that kills the player will be awarded with monies
  - The affiliation of the killer group will then be awarded with reputation and the affiliation that should be protecting the target will have a decreased reputation and this will be vice versa when the player is not killed.
- Jobs System
  - This are just the regular jobs
    - Truck Delivery
    - Garbage Collection
    - Delivery Guy
    - Etc
  - Side Note: You are still affiliated not a gang which means you really aren't a gang member or anything just a normal citizen protected by a local gang. You are just gaining street cred or reputation for yourself and/or your gang.
- Business System
  - Particularly Clear what it is
- House System
  - Particularly clear what it is
- Door System
  - Particularly clear what it is
  - Although there is a twist, creating a business and house would pull a door from this system which means houses and businesses will not have their own doors.
- Faction affiliated groups(For Government):
  - So to explain the government system. It's a collection of groups that combined together to form the government:
    - Police Department
    - Medical Department
    - Military
    - The Government itself.
  - The only affiliation that will not tax their members
  - The only affiliation that controls the whole city and not part of the city
  - The only faction that could clear a territory.
  - Basically the law and order of the state of San Fierro.(Ohh! Spoilers)
  - Joining the government faction is through hiring only basis.
- Territory system
  - For all the affiliations
  - For the Black Mambas and Silver Knights. Every territory they control will have to pay up taxes which increases this two affiliations power, taxes paid will be converted into reputatation
  - The Government on the otherhand will have to remove this territories from other affiliations. The more they have under themselves the more budget will be given to them from the Head(Something I need to think up more what this freak is)
  - A schedule of three times a day, 6 morning, 12 noon and 6 evening, server time, will cause a server Affiliation war to happen. This is the only time that the three affiliations will try to capture territories
  - Captured territories can still be taken away which makes strategy and defense will pay an important role.
  - The Affiliation that captured the most territories during the war will get reputation or budget rewards.
- Reputation System
  - Rather than money players will have to gain reputation from the street to increase their rankings and to upgrade anything they own within the affiliation. Like Affiliation exclusive cars, weapons, lockers, car storage and everything.
  - Reputation also decreases the payment of taxes.
  - Gangs will have accumulated reputation to be taken everytime a member gains a reputation, just a percentage.
  - Reputation can also be used to used for perks.
- Budget System
  - Almost the same as the Reputation but for the good guys.
  - The budget system also the one that calculates how much a member gains. The higher the budget the higher the pay so Government members should work hard.
  - The budget system also is the only monetary value that can be used by the government to upgrade themselves. Guns, Lockers, Vehicles and Etc.
- Banking System
  - Unlike normal banking systems this server will not have banks but will still have ATM's.
  - Rather than banks the Affiliation building will be the one to control this flow.
  - The main place your money goes would be the place where your affiliation is which means people should secure the buildings since robbery system is active. The only place that can't be robbed will be the government vaults.
  - Registering a bank account will be done during Affiliation Registration so please register.
  - The banking system will also be able to track the total money of the player
- Criminal System

    - Robbery
    - Burglary

  - Warrant is only needed when a government police needs to capture a player within their own house after a crime has been done, 1 hour grace period.
- Police System
  - I'll have to create a ground up on this which means you'll have to read this piece of crap and nothin' more.

## Additional Features

### Features that may be added in the future or not

- Affilation Upgrades
  - Guns will have more firepower than normal, it's a damage multiplier for all the guns, will research this more.
  - Vehicles can be fitted with armor, which can be damaged first before the cars health will be damaged, will research into this.
  - Player armours will also have an upgrade. Normal armors will damage the player with the damage of the weapon but upgraded armors will have a damage reduction rule. Don't know how to do it yet but will research it in the long run.
- Prison Break system:
  - Breaking out of the prison, I'll have to research on this on how to make it more fun. I don't want to create just a small passage way and percentage bar for escaping. It needs to be done professionally and one wrong move may cause the whole police force on your ass.
